# Welcome back in our test, it's time for step 2 !

If you did well in the first step, you should now have created an OO algorithm capable of parsing & rendering CSV files into Hashes.  
You now need to implement it in a Rails app.  

**Ruby 3.0.X**  
**Rails 6.1.X**  

----------

*Instruction:*  

- Create a Rails app
- Implement your previously built algorithm into a rails service. 


**All data should fit in at least 3 models**
- Create CRUD on 3 models: Country, Embassy, FrenchForeigner. 

- Implement and use Bootstrap to style your Frontend  
- Create associated views: Landing page + CRUD views  


`rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed` should reset local database and import all CSV's  

*Optional:*  
Forms: New, Edit  

*Specs are welcome :) *  

-----------  

You shouldn't spend more than a week for STEP 1 & 2  
This repository's purpose is learning ruby and it's a tool for us to acknowledge your determination & skills  

Dont forget to include your git file: `.git` in your repo :)
