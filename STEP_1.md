OO (Oriented Object) is powerful and help us build sturdy software.  
We'd like you to show us what you know regarding architecture and patterns

You need to parse each file and return data in Hash format printed in the console  

::Parser::File1.new

::Parser::File3.new  

Your repository must look like: 
```
my_repo  
  |-- lib  
    |-- parser1  
    |-- parser2  
    |-- parser3    
  |-- db  
    |-- csv1  
    |-- csv2  
    |-- csv3  
  |-- spec  
    |--lib  
      |-- parser1_spec  
      |-- parser2_spec  
      |-- parser3_spec  
    |-- spec_helper  
  |-- .git  
  |-- Gemfile  
 
```
As a matter of fact, we like specs, feel free to add some  
Dont forget to include your git file: `.git` in your repo :)
